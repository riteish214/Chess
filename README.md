# Chess gameplay using Python
♟️ Chess Game in Python This repository contains a fully functional implementation of the classic game of Chess using Python. Designed for educational purposes and casual play, the project focuses on recreating standard chess rules and game mechanics while offering a clean and intuitive interface for users.  The game supports:  Standard 8x8 chessboard layout  All major chess rules including piece movement (pawn, rook, knight, bishop, queen, king)  Special moves: castling, pawn promotion, and en passant  Turn-based play (white vs. black)  Legal move validation to prevent illegal plays  Check and checkmate detection  Console or GUI-based gameplay using libraries such as pygame or tkinter (depending on version)  The code is written in Python with a focus on clarity and object-oriented design. Chess pieces are represented as classes, and the game board is managed through a structured and modular system that makes the code easy to read, extend, or debug.  This project is ideal for:  Beginners and intermediate Python learners looking to work on a larger, logic-heavy application  Students interested in board game programming  Anyone wanting to understand object-oriented design through a real-world project
